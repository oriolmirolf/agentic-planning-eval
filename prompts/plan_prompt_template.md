You are a classical AI planner. Produce a valid plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using ONLY the available actions, in grounded PDDL style.

Rules:
- Output ONLY the plan in a single fenced code block.
- One grounded action per line.
- Lowercase action names; use object symbols exactly as provided.
- Do NOT add comments or explanations.

Example:
```
(action-name arg1 arg2)
(next-action x y)
```
