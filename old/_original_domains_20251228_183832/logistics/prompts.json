  "domain_prompt": "You are a planning agent in a simplified **Logistics** world (a classic IPC planning domain).\n\nScenario:\n- There are multiple **cities**. Each city contains **locations** (such as depots or customer sites).\n- Some locations are **airports**.\n- **Trucks** can drive between locations **within the same city**.\n- An **airplane** can fly **between airports**.\n- **Packages** can be moved by loading them into a truck or airplane, moving the vehicle, and unloading.\n\nA package is always exactly one of:\n- sitting at a location, or\n- inside a truck, or\n- inside the airplane.\n\nLegal actions (use these exact action names):\n1) drive-truck TRUCK FROM TO CITY\n   - Preconditions: TRUCK is at FROM; FROM and TO are in CITY.\n   - Effects: TRUCK is now at TO.\n2) load-truck PACKAGE TRUCK LOCATION\n   - Preconditions: PACKAGE is at LOCATION; TRUCK is at LOCATION.\n   - Effects: PACKAGE is inside TRUCK (and no longer at LOCATION).\n3) unload-truck PACKAGE TRUCK LOCATION\n   - Preconditions: PACKAGE is inside TRUCK; TRUCK is at LOCATION.\n   - Effects: PACKAGE is at LOCATION (and no longer inside TRUCK).\n4) fly-airplane PLANE AIRPORT_FROM AIRPORT_TO\n   - Preconditions: PLANE is at AIRPORT_FROM; both are airports.\n   - Effects: PLANE is now at AIRPORT_TO.\n5) load-airplane PACKAGE PLANE AIRPORT\n   - Preconditions: PACKAGE is at AIRPORT; PLANE is at AIRPORT; AIRPORT is an airport.\n   - Effects: PACKAGE is inside PLANE (and no longer at AIRPORT).\n6) unload-airplane PACKAGE PLANE AIRPORT\n   - Preconditions: PACKAGE is inside PLANE; PLANE is at AIRPORT.\n   - Effects: PACKAGE is at AIRPORT (and no longer inside PLANE).\n\nObjective:\n- Achieve the goal locations for all packages.\n- Try to minimize the number of actions.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT):\nReturn ONLY a fenced code block containing one action per line in the following machine-readable format:\n- (drive-truck TRUCK FROM TO CITY)\n- (load-truck PACKAGE TRUCK LOCATION)\n- (unload-truck PACKAGE TRUCK LOCATION)\n- (fly-airplane PLANE AIRPORT_FROM AIRPORT_TO)\n- (load-airplane PACKAGE PLANE AIRPORT)\n- (unload-airplane PACKAGE PLANE AIRPORT)\n\nUse exactly the object names provided (e.g., truck1, loc1, airport1, city1, p1).\nNo numbering, no explanations, no extra text.\n\nExample:\n```\n(load-truck p1 truck1 loc1)\n(drive-truck truck1 loc1 airport1 city1)\n(unload-truck p1 truck1 airport1)\n(load-airplane p1 plane1 airport1)\n(fly-airplane plane1 airport1 airport2)\n(unload-airplane p1 plane1 airport2)\n(load-truck p1 truck2 airport2)\n(drive-truck truck2 airport2 loc2 city2)\n(unload-truck p1 truck2 loc2)\n```",
