  "domain_prompt": "DOMAIN BRIEF\n\n# Summary\nA robot moves between rooms, picks up balls with its grippers, and drops them in rooms. Each action increases a cumulative total-cost. The state tracks the robot\u2019s room, where each ball is, which grippers are free, and which balls are being carried by which grippers.\n\n# Object Types\n- Room: A physical location that the robot can navigate to.\n- Ball: An object that can be picked up and transported.\n- Gripper: A robotic hand attached to the robot, capable of holding one ball at a time.\n\n# World Description\nThe robot operates in a physical environment with specific mechanical constraints:\n1. Holding Capacity: Each gripper can hold exactly one ball at a time. A gripper is either \"free\" (empty) or \"carrying\" a specific ball.\n2. Locality: To interact with a ball (pick it up), the robot must be physically present in the same room as the ball.\n3. Transport: When the robot moves between rooms, it carries with it any balls currently held in its grippers.\n4. Cost: Every action (moving, picking, or dropping) consumes energy, adding 1 to the total cost.\n\n# Actions\n\n## Action: move\n- Parameters: From Room, To Room\n- Requirements: The robot must currently be located in the 'From Room'.\n- Effects: The robot leaves the 'From Room' and arrives at the 'To Room'. This action adds 1 to the total cost.\n\n## Action: pick\n- Parameters: Target Ball, Current Room, Target Gripper\n- Requirements: The robot must be in the Current Room. The Target Ball must also be in the Current Room. The Target Gripper must be free (not holding anything).\n- Effects: The gripper grabs the ball. The ball is now held by the gripper and removed from the room's floor. The gripper is no longer free. This action adds 1 to the total cost.\n\n## Action: drop\n- Parameters: Target Ball, Current Room, Target Gripper\n- Requirements: The robot must be in the Current Room. The Target Gripper must be holding the Target Ball.\n- Effects: The robot releases the ball. The ball is placed in the Current Room. The gripper becomes free. This action adds 1 to the total cost.",
