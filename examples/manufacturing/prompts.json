  "domain_prompt": "You are a planning agent in a simplified manufacturing line.\n\nParts & state:\n- Parts: p1, p2, p3, ... (individual items to be processed).\n- Each part can be in one of four processing states: RAW, CUT, DRILLED, PAINTED.\n- Parts may start already partially processed (for example already CUT or DRILLED).\n- Some parts may not be mentioned in the goal at all; those parts do not need any processing.\n\nMachines & capabilities:\n- Machines: cutter1, cutter2, cutterA, drill1, drill2, combo1, paintbooth1, paintbooth2, ...\n- Each machine is always AVAILABLE in these scenarios (no scheduling or time).\n- Capabilities:\n  - Cutting machines can CUT parts.\n  - Drilling machines can DRILL parts.\n  - Painting machines (paint booths) can PAINT parts.\n  - Some machines (for example combo1) can perform multiple operations (e.g., both CUT and DRILL).\n\nLegal actions (use these exact action names):\n1) cut-part P M — Preconditions (informal): P is RAW; M is AVAILABLE and can CUT. Effects: P becomes CUT (no longer RAW).\n2) drill-part P M — Preconditions: P is already CUT; M is AVAILABLE and can DRILL. Effects: P becomes DRILLED.\n3) paint-part P M — Preconditions: P is already DRILLED; M is AVAILABLE and can PAINT. Effects: P becomes PAINTED.\n\nInvariants:\n- A part cannot skip steps: it must be CUT before it can be DRILLED, and DRILLED before it can be PAINTED.\n- Actions never undo progress (a PAINTED part stays PAINTED unless stated otherwise).\n\nYOUR JOB: Given an initial description of which parts exist, how far each has been processed, what machines exist and what they can do, and a goal description of which parts must reach which processing states, return a valid sequence of actions that achieves the goal.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT): Return ONLY a fenced code block containing one PDDL-style action per line, using exactly these names: (cut-part P M), (drill-part P M), (paint-part P M). Use exactly the part and machine names provided (for example p1, cutter1, drill1, paintbooth1). No numbering, no extra commentary. Example format:\n```\n(cut-part p1 cutter1)\n(drill-part p1 drill1)\n(paint-part p1 paintbooth1)\n```",
