  "domain_prompt": "DOMAIN BRIEF\n\n# Summary\nThis domain models hospital bed management. Patients are admitted to, transferred between, and discharged from beds in wards. Beds can be free, dirty, or blocked, and some patients require isolation-capable beds. Actions update patient and bed states and accumulate total-cost.\n\n# Object Types\n- Patient: A person requiring medical care.\n- Bed: A physical resource where a patient stays.\n- Ward: A specific department or area of the hospital (e.g., ICU, General) containing specific beds.\n\n# World Description\nThe hospital operates under strict hygiene and safety protocols:\n1. Bed Lifecycle: A bed is not just \"empty\" or \"full.\" It cycles through states. A bed starts as **Free**. After a patient leaves it (transfer or discharge), it becomes **Dirty** and must be cleaned before it is Free again. It can also be **Blocked** for maintenance.\n2. Ward Alignment: Every patient is assigned to a specific Ward type. They can only be placed in beds that physically belong to that same Ward.\n3. Isolation Protocol: Some patients are contagious or immune-compromised and are flagged as \"Isolation Required.\" These patients can *only* be placed in beds marked as \"Isolation Capable.\" Non-isolation patients can use any bed.\n4. Cost: Every administrative action (admitting, moving, cleaning) consumes hospital resources, adding 1 to the Total Cost.\n\n# Actions\n\n## Action: admit\n- Parameters: Target Patient, Target Bed, Target Ward\n- Requirements: The Patient must be currently waiting for admission. The Target Bed must be Free (clean and empty). The Patient must require the specific Ward that the Bed belongs to. Crucially, if the Patient requires isolation, the Bed must be isolation-capable.\n- Effects: The Patient is placed in the Bed. The Bed is no longer Free. The Patient is no longer waiting. This action adds 1 to the total cost.\n\n## Action: transfer\n- Parameters: Target Patient, From Bed, To Bed, Target Ward\n- Requirements: Move a patient from one bed to another. The Patient must currently be in the 'From Bed'. The 'To Bed' must be Free. The Patient's Ward requirement must match the 'To Bed'. The isolation rules still apply: if the patient needs isolation, the new bed must support it.\n- Effects: The Patient is moved to the 'To Bed'. The 'From Bed' becomes Dirty (it must be cleaned before reuse). The 'To Bed' is no longer Free. This action adds 1 to the total cost.\n\n## Action: discharge\n- Parameters: Target Patient, Current Bed\n- Requirements: The Patient must currently be in the Current Bed.\n- Effects: The Patient leaves the hospital (status becomes discharged). The Current Bed becomes Dirty. This action adds 1 to the total cost.\n\n## Action: clean-bed\n- Parameters: Target Bed\n- Requirements: The bed must currently be Dirty. It cannot be Blocked.\n- Effects: The bed becomes Free and ready for a new patient. The Dirty status is removed. This action adds 1 to the total cost.\n\n## Action: block-bed\n- Parameters: Target Bed\n- Requirements: The bed must be currently Free (empty and clean). It cannot be already Blocked.\n- Effects: The bed becomes Blocked (unavailable for use). It is no longer Free. This action adds 1 to the total cost.\n\n## Action: unblock-bed\n- Parameters: Target Bed\n- Requirements: The bed must currently be Blocked.\n- Effects: The bed becomes Free again. The Blocked status is removed. This action adds 1 to the total cost.",
