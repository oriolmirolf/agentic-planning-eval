Beds can be free, dirty, or blocked, and some patients require isolation-capable beds. Actions update patient and bed states and accumulate total-cost.\n\n# Object Types\n- patient: Base object\n- bed: Base object\n- ward: Base object\n\n# Predicates & Functions\n- patient-ward ?p ?w: Patient ?p requires ward ?w.\n- bed-ward ?b ?w: Bed ?b belongs to ward ?w.\n- isolation-required ?p: Patient ?p requires isolation.\n- isolation-bed ?b: Bed ?b is isolation-capable.\n- waiting ?p: Patient ?p is waiting for admission.\n- in-bed ?p ?b: Patient ?p is currently in bed ?b.\n- discharged ?p: Patient ?p has been discharged.\n- bed-free ?b: Bed ?b is empty and usable.\n- bed-dirty ?b: Bed ?b needs cleaning before use.\n- bed-blocked ?b: Bed ?b is unavailable (maintenance or reserved).\n- total-cost: Cumulative action cost metric.\n\n# Actions\n\n## Action: admit\n- Parameters: ?p (patient), ?b (bed), ?w (ward)\n- Preconditions:\n  - Patient ?p is waiting.\n  - It is not the case that patient ?p is discharged.\n  - Bed ?b is bed-free.\n  - It is not the case that bed ?b is bed-dirty.\n  - It is not the case that bed ?b is bed-blocked.\n  - Patient-ward ?p ?w holds: patient ?p requires ward ?w.\n  - Bed-ward ?b ?w holds: bed ?b belongs to the same ward ?w.\n  - Either it is not the case that isolation-required ?p, or isolation-bed ?b holds. In other words: if patient ?p requires isolation, then bed ?b must be isolation-bed.\n- Effects:\n  - It is no longer the case that patient ?p is waiting.\n  - Patient ?p is in-bed ?b.\n  - It is no longer the case that bed ?b is bed-free.\n  - Increase total-cost by 1.\n\n## Action: transfer\n- Parameters: ?p (patient), ?from (bed), ?to (bed), ?w (ward)\n- Preconditions:\n  - Patient ?p is in-bed ?from.\n  - Bed ?to is bed-free.\n  - It is not the case that bed ?to is bed-dirty.\n  - It is not the case that bed ?to is bed-blocked.\n  - Patient-ward ?p ?w holds: patient ?p requires ward ?w.\n  - Bed-ward ?to ?w holds: bed ?to belongs to the same ward ?w.\n  - Either it is not the case that isolation-required ?p, or isolation-bed ?to holds. In other words: if patient ?p requires isolation, then bed ?to must be isolation-bed.\n- Effects:\n  - Patient ?p is in-bed ?to.\n  - It is no longer the case that patient ?p is in-bed ?from.\n  - Bed ?from becomes bed-dirty.\n  - It is no longer the case that bed ?to is bed-free.\n  - Increase total-cost by 1.\n\n## Action: discharge\n- Parameters: ?p (patient), ?b (bed)\n- Preconditions:\n  - Patient ?p is in-bed ?b.\n- Effects:\n  - Patient ?p becomes discharged.\n  - It is no longer the case that patient ?p is in-bed ?b.\n  - Bed ?b becomes bed-dirty.\n  - Increase total-cost by 1.\n\n## Action: clean-bed\n- Parameters: ?b (bed)\n- Preconditions:\n  - Bed ?b is bed-dirty.\n  - It is not the case that bed ?b is bed-blocked.\n- Effects:\n  - It is no longer the case that bed ?b is bed-dirty.\n  - Bed ?b becomes bed-free.\n  - Increase total-cost by 1.\n\n## Action: block-bed\n- Parameters: ?b (bed)\n- Preconditions:\n  - Bed ?b is bed-free.\n  - It is not the case that bed ?b is bed-blocked.\n- Effects:\n  - Bed ?b becomes bed-blocked.\n  - It is no longer the case that bed ?b is bed-free.\n  - Increase total-cost by 1.\n\n## Action: unblock-bed\n- Parameters: ?b (bed)\n- Preconditions:\n  - Bed ?b is bed-blocked.\n- Effects:\n  - It is no longer the case that bed ?b is bed-blocked.\n  - Bed ?b becomes bed-free.\n  - Increase total-cost by 1.\n\nFINAL CHECK\n- All action names are identical to the PDDL.\n- All Lisp syntax is removed and replaced with clear English statements.\n- Preconditions and effects for every action are fully and precisely translated, including disjunctive and negative conditions and all numeric cost changes.",
