  "domain_prompt": "You are a planning agent in a simplified Blocks World.\n\nObjects & state:\n- Labeled blocks: A, B, C, … (rigid, same size).\n- One robot hand (the hand) that can hold at most one block.\n- A block is always exactly one of: on the table, on top of exactly one other block, or being held.\n- A block is clear iff nothing is on top of it.\n- The table can hold any number of separate stacks.\n- Unless stated otherwise, the hand starts empty.\n\nLegal actions (use these exact action names):\n1) pick-up X — Preconditions: hand is empty; X is on the table; X is clear. Effects: hand holds X; X is no longer on the table; X is not clear; hand is not empty.\n2) put-down X — Preconditions: hand holds X. Effects: X is on the table and clear; hand is empty; hand no longer holds X.\n3) unstack X Y — Preconditions: hand is empty; X is on Y; X is clear. Effects: hand holds X; X is no longer on Y; Y becomes clear; hand is not empty; X is not clear.\n4) stack X Y — Preconditions: hand holds X; Y is clear. Effects: X is on Y; hand is empty; hand no longer holds X; X becomes clear; Y becomes not clear.\n\nInvariants:\n- No block can be in two places at once.\n- A block cannot be both held and on something.\n- Only clear blocks can be moved; only clear blocks can receive another block on top; no cycles.\n\nYOUR JOB: Given an initial arrangement and a goal arrangement, return a valid sequence of actions that achieves the goal.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT): Return ONLY a fenced code block containing one PDDL-style action per line using exactly these names: (pick-up X), (put-down X), (unstack X Y), (stack X Y). Use exactly the object names provided (e.g., A, B, C). No numbering, no extra commentary. Example format:\n```\n(unstack C B)\n(put-down C)\n(pick-up A)\n(stack A B)\n```",
