"domain_prompt": "DOMAIN BRIEF\n\n# Summary\nThis domain models a classic blocks world with a single robot arm. Blocks can be on the table, on top of other blocks, clear on top, held by the arm, or free with the arm empty. The available actions are pick-up, put-down, stack, and unstack, each changing which block is held, which surfaces are clear, and where blocks are located.\n\n# Object Types\n- Block: A standard block that can be stacked or moved.\n\n# World Description\nThe robot operates in a physical environment governed by specific manipulation rules:\n1. Grip Limit: The robot has a single arm. It can either be holding exactly one block or be empty. It cannot hold two blocks at once.\n2. The Table: The table is the base surface. Any number of blocks can sit directly on the table.\n3. Stacking Physics: Blocks can be stacked on top of one another to form towers. A block is considered \"clear\" if nothing is resting on top of it.\n4. Accessibility: You can only pick up or stack onto a block if it is currently clear. You cannot move a block that is buried under others.\n\n# Actions\n\n## Action: pick-up\n- Parameters: Target Block\n- Requirements: This action picks up a block from the table. The Target Block must be currently on the table, it must be clear (nothing on top of it), and the robot arm must be empty.\n- Effects: The robot arm is now holding the Target Block. The arm is no longer empty. The block is no longer on the table and is no longer marked as clear (since it is being held).\n\n## Action: put-down\n- Parameters: Target Block\n- Requirements: This action places a block onto the table. The robot arm must currently be holding the Target Block.\n- Effects: The Target Block is placed on the table. It becomes clear (nothing on top). The robot arm becomes empty and is no longer holding the block.\n\n## Action: stack\n- Parameters: Target Block, Underlying Block\n- Requirements: This action stacks one block on top of another. The robot arm must be holding the Target Block, and the Underlying Block must be clear (nothing on top of it).\n- Effects: The Target Block is placed on top of the Underlying Block. The Target Block becomes clear. The Underlying Block is no longer clear. The robot arm becomes empty.\n\n## Action: unstack\n- Parameters: Target Block, Underlying Block\n- Requirements: This action lifts a block off of another block. The Target Block must be sitting on top of the Underlying Block. The Target Block must be clear, and the robot arm must be empty.\n- Effects: The robot arm is now holding the Target Block. The Underlying Block becomes clear (since the top block was removed). The Target Block is no longer clear and no longer on the Underlying Block. The arm is no longer empty.",
