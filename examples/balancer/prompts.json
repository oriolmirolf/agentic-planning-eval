"domain_prompt": "DOMAIN BRIEF\n\n# Summary\nThis domain models load balancing across servers in regions. Servers host services and can be powered on or off. Buckets belong to regions and require specific services. You must manage these resources to assign buckets efficiently.\n\n# Object Types\n- Server: A computing node that can process workloads.\n- Region: A physical location where servers and buckets reside.\n- Service: A specific software application required to process a bucket.\n- Bucket: A unit of data workload that needs to be processed.\n\n# World Description\nThe world operates under strict constraints regarding location, power, and capacity:\n1. Topology: Every server and bucket is permanently located in a specific Region. Interactions (like assigning a bucket) can only happen if objects are in the same region.\n2. Resource State: Servers have two states: Online (powered on) or Offline. They also manage a list of active Services. A server can only accept work if it is Online and running the required Service.\n3. Capacity Limits: Every server has a fixed Capacity. The system tracks the current Load (number of buckets assigned). You cannot assign a bucket if the server's Load has reached its Capacity.\n4. Cost: Every action you take increases the global Total Cost by 1.\n\n# Actions\n\n## Action: power-on\n- Parameters: Target Server\n- Requirements: You can only power on a server if it is currently offline.\n- Effects: The server becomes online. This increases the total cost by 1.\n\n## Action: power-off\n- Parameters: Target Server\n- Requirements: To power off a server, it must currently be online. Furthermore, the server must be completely idle (its current load must be 0, meaning no buckets are assigned to it).\n- Effects: The server becomes offline. This increases the total cost by 1.\n\n## Action: start-service\n- Parameters: Target Server, Target Service\n- Requirements: The server must be online. It must not already be running the specified service.\n- Effects: The server begins running the service. This increases the total cost by 1.\n\n## Action: stop-service\n- Parameters: Target Server, Target Service\n- Requirements: The server must be online and must currently be running the specified service.\n- Effects: The server stops running the service. This increases the total cost by 1.\n\n## Action: assign-bucket\n- Parameters: Target Bucket, Target Server, Context Region, Context Service\n- Requirements: This action assigns a workload to a server. For this to be valid:\n  1. The bucket must be currently unassigned.\n  2. The server must be online.\n  3. The bucket and the server must be in the same region.\n  4. The bucket requires a specific service, and the server must be running that exact service.\n  5. The server must have available space (its current load must be strictly less than its capacity).\n- Effects: The bucket is marked as assigned to the server. The server's load count increases by 1. This increases the total cost by 1.\n\n## Action: unassign-bucket\n- Parameters: Target Bucket, Target Server\n- Requirements: You can only unassign a bucket if it is currently assigned to this specific server.\n- Effects: The bucket becomes unassigned. The server's load count decreases by 1. This increases the total cost by 1.",
